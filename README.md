# PCEP-30-02 - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer

The PCEPâ„¢ certification shows that the individual is familiar with the following concepts: fundamental terms and definitions (e.g. compilation vs. interpretation), Python's logic and structure (e.g. keywords, instructions, indentation), literals, variables, and numeral systems, operators and data types, I/O operations, control flow mechanisms (conditional blocks and loops), data collections (lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings), functions (decomposition, built-in and user-defined functions, organizing interaction between functions and their environment, generators, recursion), exceptions (exception handling, hierarchies), as well as the essentials of Python programming language syntax, semantics, and the runtime environment.
