### Programming Basic Concepts

Computer Program - A computer program is a set of instructions or statements that tell a computer what tasks to perform. It is a sequence of coded commands that are executed by a computer or computing device to carry out specific operations or solve a problem.

Instruction list - An instructions list, also known as a program or a code, is a sequence of instructions that directs a computer on how to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Each instruction represents a specific action or operation that the computer should execute.

Machine code - Machine code, also known as machine language, is the lowest-level programming language that is directly understood and executed by a computer's hardware. It consists of a series of binary instructions, which are represented as a sequence of 0s and 1s. Each instruction in machine code corresponds to a specific operation that the computer's processor can directly execute.

Source code - Source code refers to the human-readable form of a computer program. It is the original representation of a program written by a programmer using a programming language. Source code consists of statements, instructions, and data structures that define the logic and behavior of a software application.

Compilation - Compilation is the process of converting source code written in a high-level programming language into a lower-level language, such as machine code, that can be executed directly by a computer's hardware. The transformation is performed by a special software program called a compiler.

Interpretation - Interpretation is a method of executing a computer program where the source code is not compiled into machine code beforehand. Instead, an interpreter reads and executes the source code directly, line by line, during runtime. It translates and executes each instruction or statement as it encounters them.
